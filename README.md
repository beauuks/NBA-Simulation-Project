# NBA Simulation Project üèÄ
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Work in Progress
**Note: This is an incomplete simulation project and is actively under development.**

## Overview
This is a Python-based NBA game simulation project that demonstrates advanced concurrent programming techniques, including:

- Multithreading
- Multiprocessing
- Database integration
- Realistic sports game simulation

## Features
### Game Simulation

- Simulates NBA basketball games with:
  - Quarter-by-quarter gameplay
  - Random event generation
  - Scoring mechanics


### Stadium Operations

- Concurrent simulation of:
  - Security entry
  - Concessions sales
  - Merchandise operations


### Data Persistence

- SQLite database integration
- Logging of game events and statistics
- Post-game statistical reporting

## Technical Components

- Utilizes threading for concurrent game and stadium operations
- Uses ProcessPoolExecutor for conference-level parallelism
- Generates detailed logging
- Implements thread-safe data structures

## Requirements

- Libraries:
  - threading
  - queue
  - sqlite3
  - pandas
  - json


## Limitations and TODOs

 - More sophisticated game mechanics
 - Enhanced player performance modeling
 - Expanded team and player data
 - Realistic player and team statistics
 - More comprehensive statistical analysis
 - External API integration for real-time data
 - Improved error handling
 - More detailed stadium operation simulations
