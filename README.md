# NBA Simulation Project üèÄ

## Overview
This is a Python-based NBA game simulation project that demonstrates advanced concurrent programming techniques, including:

- Multithreading
- Multiprocessing
- Database integration
- Realistic sports game simulation

## Features
### Game Simulation

- Simulates NBA basketball games with:
  - Quarter-by-quarter gameplay
  - Random event generation
  - Scoring mechanics
  - Player stats
  - Home-game advantages


### Stadium Operations

- Concurrent simulation of:
  - Security entry
  - Concessions sales
  - Merchandise operations


### Data Persistence

- SQLite database integration
- Logging of game events and statistics
- Post-game statistical reporting

## Technical Components

- Utilizes threading for concurrent game and stadium operations
- Uses ProcessPoolExecutor for conference-level parallelism
- Generates detailed logging
- Implements thread-safe data structures


## Course Context
This project was developed as a comprehensive assignment for the **Operating Systems and Parallel Computing** course. It serves to demonstrate practical applications of:

- Concurrent programming techniques
- Parallel computing principles
- Thread synchronization
- Resource management
